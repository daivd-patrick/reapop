## Questions & bugs reporting ##

When you create an issue to report a bug or ask a question, think about include useful information like :

 - Operating system with version
 - Browser with version
 - Reapop version (original or not)
 - React version
 - Redux version

and all others related information that are susceptible to help us.

### Pull requests  ##

All pull requests must be done on the **dev** branch.

Before a pull request :

 - Don't forget to update README or documentation if it's necessary
 - Check code status with `npm run lint` 
 - Run tests with `npm run test` 
 - If you made styles changes or any changes related to user interfaces, launch demo with `npm start` to check the result in the browser. Check it on all possible browsers that you have. (Precise the list in the PR)
